# Pep2d-SS8-Preprocessing
This repository contains a Python tool developed for extracting 8-state secondary structure labels from PDB files using Biopython and DSSP.

## Overview
- Goal: Automate ss8 labeling of FASTA sequences in PEP2d dataset (can be easily generalized for any dataset).
- Tools used: Biopython, Pytorch, DSSP, PDB database
